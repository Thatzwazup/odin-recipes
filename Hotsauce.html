      <li>1 cup vinegar</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        If using fresh chili peppers, wash and dry them. If using dried chili
        peppers, soak them in hot water for about 20 minutes to soften.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the stems and seeds from the chili peppers, and roughly chop
        them.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a small saucepan, combine the chopped chili peppers, vinegar, salt,
        and sugar. Add any optional seasonings you like.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about
        10-15 minutes, or until the peppers are very soft.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the mixture cool for a few
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using an immersion blender or regular blender, blend the mixture until
        it is smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the sauce is too thick, add a bit of water or more vinegar to thin it
        out.
      </li>
      <li>Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning as necessary.</li>
      <li>
        Transfer the hot sauce to a sterilized jar or bottle, and store it in
        the refrigerator.
      </li>
